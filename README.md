# Olist E-commerce Analysis

![](introduc_image.png)

## Introduction

Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers across Brazil. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list
their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online. The Olist sales dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) is a collection of anonymized data about orders
placed on the Olist platform between January 2017 and August 2018. It contains a wide range
of information about each order, including the order date, product details, payment and shipping
information, customer IDs, and customer reviews, as well as information about the sellers who list their products on the platform

The project aimed to support Olist in gaining deeper insights into their e-commerce platform, thereby maximizing potential growth opportunities available to them.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights derived from the analysis, the following possible recommendations can be applied:

1. **Focus on High-Rated Sellers:** Encourage and support sellers with higher ratings (4 and 5). They tend to generate more sales. Offering them additional support or incentives could further enhance their performance and contribute to increased revenue.

2. **Customer Retention Strategies:** Identify and learn from the 6% of customers who place multiple orders. Implement targeted strategies like loyalty programs or personalized discounts to retain and nurture this segment for increased recurring sales.

3. **Payment Method Optimization:** Given credit cards are the most popular payment method, consider optimizing the payment experience for credit card users. However, also try to improve the experience for users of Boleto and debit cards to cater to their preferences.

4. **Product Category Expansion:** As certain categories like bed_bath_table, health_beauty, computers_accessories, and furniture_decor are performing well, consider expanding product offerings within these categories or similar high-growth categories to capitalize on their sales potential.

5. **Geographical Focus:** Concentrate marketing efforts on São Paulo due to its high customer concentration. Additionally, explore the strategies used in Acre to achieve a high customer retention rate and see if those strategies can be applied in other regions to improve customer retention across the board.

6. **Profit Margin Analysis:** Focus on optimizing product offerings or marketing efforts within categories such as fixed_telephony, drinks, and signaling_and_security, which have higher profit margins. This could involve promoting these categories more prominently or adjusting pricing strategies to maximize profitability.

7. **Maintaining Customer Satisfaction:** Given the low order cancellation rate indicating high customer satisfaction, continue efforts to maintain or improve customer satisfaction levels. This might involve providing excellent customer service, quick issue resolution, and enhancing overall user experience on the platform.

Implementing these recommendations while constantly analyzing and adapting strategies based on ongoing data and market trends can significantly contribute to Olist's growth and success.
